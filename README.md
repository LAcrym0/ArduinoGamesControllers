# ArduinoGamesControllers

This repository contains 3 exemples of game controllers designed to be used with an Arduino (we made tests with an Arduino Leonardo).
To use it, simply link the Arduino to your computer, it will automatically be recognized as a keyboard.

## Joystick Micro Controller
This controller allows the user to play simple games like Bombergirl (http://bombergirl.matousskala.cz). The character moves with the joystick and the action (plant a bomb) can be done by saying "Boom" in the microphone sensor. This is a fun way to play this game with unusual controls.

## Keypad Controller
This controller allows the user to play simple games like Bombergirl (http://bombergirl.matousskala.cz) too. The character moves with the binded keys :
2 for up
4 for left
6 for right
8 for down
and makes the action (plant a bomb) with the 5 key. This can replace the computer keyboard to permit an other way to play little games.

## Trackpad Controller
This controller allows the user to play simple games like Space Invader. The spaceship moves with the trackpad swiped to the left or to the right. The action must still be done by using the computer's keyboard.
