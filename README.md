# ArduinoGamesControllers

This repository contains 3 exemples of game controllers designed to be used with an Arduino (we made tests with an Arduino Leonardo).

## Joystick Micro Controller
This controller allows the user to play simple games like Bombergirl (http://bombergirl.matousskala.cz). The character moves with the joystick and the action (plant a bomb) can be done by saying "Boom" in the microphone sensor. This is a fun way to play this game with unusual controls

## Keypad Controller
This controller allows the user to play simple games like Bombergirl (http://bombergirl.matousskala.cz) too. The character moves with the binded keys :
2 for up
4 for left
6 for right
8 for down
and makes the action (plant a bomb) with the 5 key. This can replace the computer keyboard to permit an other way to play little games
